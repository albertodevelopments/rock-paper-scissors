## Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors

This is a version of the old classic game that we all played during our childhood!

### How to use it

I think we all here know the rules. Anyway, I will explain. You have to pick one of the icons representing rock, paper or scissors, and wait for the result. The house will make its choice then, and after a few seconds, a new screen will be shown with the result. You will find a score box at the top of the page to control your progress!

### Additional functionality

This game is fully responsive, so access with your smart phone or tablet and enjoy!

ThatÂ´s all! Just play around!
